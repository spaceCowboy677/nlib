# nlib : General Numerical Methods Library

This library is to facilitate fast execution of generalized numerical tasks. 

This library is derived from modern implementations of code listed in "Numerical Recipes in C" by William Press, Brian Flannery, Saul Teukolsky, and William Vetterling. Certain optimizations might not apply for certain architectures.
